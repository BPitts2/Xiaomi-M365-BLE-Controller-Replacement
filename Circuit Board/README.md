I have been looking at different ways to mount the replacement controller onto the scooter via a custom circuit board, but I am still finalizing the design.

I just placed an order for 2 different designs, one that will need to be mounted with rectangular project box and the other is the same size as the factory board (I will probably have to replace the dashboard as the replacement controller will have a greater height than the factory board).

My previous orders have allowed me to create a more professional looking schematic
